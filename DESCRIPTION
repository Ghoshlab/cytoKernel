Description: cytoKernel implements a kernel-based test to
             identify differentially expressed features
             in high-dimensional biological experiments. This
             approach can be applied across many different
             high-dimensional biological data including gene 
             expression data and dimensionally reduced 
             cytometry-based marker expression data.
