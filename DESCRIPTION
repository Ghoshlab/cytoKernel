Description: cytoKernel implements a kernel-based score test to
             identify differentially expressed features
             in high-dimensional biological experiments. This
             approach can be applied across many different
             high-dimensional biological data including
             Flow/Mass Cytometry data and other variety of gene 
             expression data.
